---- simplest-----
download and run the installer:


aliview.install.run


(this is a executable archive that will copy the files to the /usr/home/bin/ and /usr/share)
on some systems you need to change the execution rights of the install file:

chmod +x aliview.install.run 
sudo ./aliview.install.run 

(most likely you need to sudo the installation)

start the program with aliview (this is a sh script that will execute java -jar aliview.jar)

----- alternative-----
aliview.tgz is an archive including the program files
