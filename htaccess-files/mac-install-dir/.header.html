<b>OBS!</b>
<br>
On Mavericks or Sierra you might get an <b>error message: "This application is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the Trash." </b>
- The file is actually not damaged, it is just a bad error message. There is a settings in the "Gatekeeper" 
that you need to change to be able to download software from other places than the App-store.
