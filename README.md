<strong>AliView is yet another alignment viewer and editor, but this one is probably one of the fastest and most intuitive to use, less bloated and hopefully in your likings...</strong>

The general idea when designing this program has always been speed, light-weight and simplicity, all new functions were always optimized so they did not affect the general performance and capability to work with unlimited file sizes.

A need to easily sort, view, remove, edit and merge sequences from large transcriptome datasets initiated the work with the program.
- edit (manually)
- align, add and align automatically (with muscle or mafft or any other aligner of your choise)
- find degenerate primers in conserved regions in an alignment of mixed species
- handles fasta, nexus or phylip-format (unlimited file sizes)
- on the fly translation of nucleotides to amino acids
- various visual cues to highligt consensus characters or characters deviating from consensus
- simple copy/paste/drop/remove of sequences/files
- a very simple to use interface that invokes other of your favourite programs (you could for example automatically have the alignment sent to FastTree and then automatically opened in FigTree).

The program is developed at department of Systematic Biology (Uppsala University) so there is probably a predominance in functionality supporting someone working with phylogenies.
