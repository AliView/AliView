Install:

-***---*** SIMPLEST ***---***-

download and run the installer:

aliview.install.run

(this is a executable archive that will copy the file "aliview" to the /usr/home/bin/ and the rest to /usr/share/aliview/)

on most systems you need to change the execution rights of the downloaded file:

chmod +x aliview.install.run 
sudo ./aliview.install.run 

(most likely you need to sudo the installation)

start the program with aliview (this is a .sh script that will execute java -jar aliview.jar)


----*** ALTERNATIVE ***----
aliview.tgz is an archive including the program files
