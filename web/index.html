<h3><a href="downloads">Current version: 1.07</a> (<a href="version_history.txt">version history</a>)</h3>

<p>AliView is yet another alignment viewer and editor, but this is probably one
of the fastest and most intuitive to use, not so bloated and hopefully in your
likings...</p>
<img style="width: 383px;" alt="" src="images/prog1.png"><br>


<p>The general idea when designing this program has always been speed and
usability, all new functions were always optimized so they did not affect the
general performance and capability to work swiftly with large alignments. </p>

<p>A need to easily sort, view, remove, edit and merge sequences from large
transcriptome datasets initiated the work with the program.</p>
- edit (manually)<br>
- align, add and align automatically (with muscle or mafft or any other aligner
of your choice)<br>
- find degenerate primers in conserved regions in an alignment of mixed
species<br>
- handles fasta, nexus or phylip-format (unlimited file sizes)<br>
- on the fly translation of nucleotides to amino acids<br>
- various visual cues to highlight consensus characters or characters deviating
from consensus<br>
- simple copy/paste/drop/remove of sequences/files<br>
- a very simple to use "external interface" that lets you invoke other of your
favorite programs (you could for example automatically have the alignment sent
to FastTree and then automatically opened in FigTree).<br>
<br>
The program is developed at department of Systematic Biology (Uppsala
University) so there is probably a predominance in functionality supporting
someone working with phylogenies.<br>

<h2><a name="file_menu">File menu:</a></h2>

<p><strong>Open File</strong>: AliView will open files in Fasta, Nexus and
Phylip format.</p>

<p><strong>Save as Nexus simplified names</strong>: Unorthodox characters (-
\?./|\,&amp;) in Sequence names are replaced by "_"</p>

<p><strong>Save as Codonpos Nexus (nucleotide dataset only):</strong> All pos 1
nucleotides are saved as one charset in beginning of alignment, thereafter all 2
pos nucleotides as one charset, then all 3 pos and finally all non-coding
(0-pos). </p>

<p><strong>Print:</strong> Apart from printing to paper, it is often possible
in the settings to "print to file", this way you can get post script (ps) files
of the alignment.</p>

<p><strong>Export alignment as image:</strong> This will save the entire
alignment as an .png image file</p>

<p><strong>Save selection as Fasta:</strong> Only the selected sequences, or
selected parts of sequences will be included in the .fasta file - a very simple
way of pruning away things from your alignment.</p>

<p><strong>Save Translated alignment as Amino acids (nucleotide dataset
only):</strong> Program will translate nucleotides into AminoAcids (taking into
account user specified edits in codon positions when translating)</p>

<p><strong>Start debug:</strong> Prints more messages</p>

<p><strong>Show message log:</strong> Displays program messages and errors in a
message window</p>

<p></p>

<h2><a name="edit_menu">Edit:</a></h2>

<p>When opening very large files and they are indexed, then the editing
capabilities are very limited - but if you need to edit it might be possible if
you increase the Memory resources for AliViev <a href="#memory_settings">see
here</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Undo/Redo:</strong> AliView has undo/redo functionality (except from
when large indexed files are read from file). Depending on the <a
href="#memory_settings">Memory settings</a>, the number of possible undo/redo
steps change.</p>

<p><strong>Copy selection as Fasta:</strong> The selected sequences/characters
are copied into clipboard as a Fasta sequences (including both name and
sequence).</p>

<p><strong>Copy selection as characters:</strong> The selected
sequences/characters are copied into clipboard as characters only - Not
including the names of the sequences where characters come from.</p>

<p><strong>Paste (fasta sequences):</strong> Sequence(s) will be pasted at top
of alignment if clipboard contains <strong>either</strong> File containing
fasta sequences <strong>or</strong> text in fasta format, e.g.:<br>
&gt;Name_of_seq<br>
TTGGGCATG<br>
</p>

<p><strong>Add sequences from file:</strong> Add sequence(s) from a file to be
pasted at top of alignment (FASTA,PHYLIP or NEXUS file format).</p>

<p><strong>Edit mode:</strong> It is not possible to edit alignment by accident
unless you activate "Edit Mode".</p>

<p><strong>Clear selected bases:</strong> Changes selected
nucleotides/AminoAcids into GAP.</p>

<p><strong>Delete selected</strong> Removes selected
sequences/nucleotides/AminoAcids from alignment.</p>

<p><strong>Delete selected bases:</strong> Removes selected
nucleotides/AminoAcids from sequences/alignment.</p>

<p><strong>Delete vertical gaps:</strong> If there are column(s) in the
alignment only containing GAP these positions are removed.</p>

<p><strong>Delete all gaps in all sequences:</strong> Degap the whole
alignment.</p>

<p><strong>Trim sequences/alignment:</strong> If there are column(s) in the
beginning or at the end of the alignment containing GAP only, then these
positions are removed.</p>

<p><strong>Excludes (Nexus specification)</strong> can be useful if you have an
alignment with sections that you don't want to remove permanently - but
sometimes when you make an analysis. Then you can save the alignment with the
"Excluded" sections removed and use that alignment for the analysis.</p>

<p><strong>Delete excluded bases:</strong> Removes sections of the alignment
are marked as "Excludes" (Nexus specification). See also above under Excludes
(Nexus specification).</p>

<p><strong>Find </strong> Finds in name or nucleotides/aminoacids - searches
across gaps and obey IUPAC codes.</p>

<p><strong>Find sequence names from clipboard</strong> Finds and selects
sequence(s) matching names that are stored in clipboard as list.<br>
example list in clipboard:<br>
Woodsia<br>
Athyrium<br>
Dryopteris </p>

<p><strong>Merge two selected sequences:</strong> If there is an non identical
overlap AliView will create a consensus sequence.</p>

<p><strong>Reverse complement clipboard:</strong> Will reverse complement
characters/fasta sequences that are stored in clipboard.</p>

<h2><a name="selection_menu">Selection:</a></h2>

<p><strong>Move selected sequences up</strong></p>

<p><strong>Move selected sequences down</strong></p>

<p><strong>Move selected sequences to top</strong></p>

<p><strong>Move selected sequences to bottom</strong></p>

<p><strong>Add selection to Excludes:</strong> Marks sections of the alignment
as "Excludes" (Nexus specification). See also above under Excludes (this is
saved in the NEXUS Excludes block).</p>

<p><strong>Remove selection from Excludes:</strong> Removes selected sections
of the alignment from "Excludes" (if they are included already). See also above
under Excludes (Nexus specification).</p>

<p><strong>Select charset:</strong> If the alignment file have charsets defined
you can select one.</p>

<p><strong>Set selection as coding:</strong> In a nucleotide alignment you can
specify the coding regions, pick the start position of the selection and then
further bases will be marked as codon position 1,2,3,1,2,3... and so forth.
(this is saved in the NEXUS Codonpos block)</p>

<p><strong>Set selection as Non-coding:</strong> Set bases as non-coding (this
is saved in the NEXUS Codonpos block)</p>

<h2><a name="view_menu">View:</a></h2>

<p><strong>Decrease Font Size</strong></p>

<p><strong>Decrease Font Size</strong></p>

<p><strong>Highlight consensus characters</strong> Characters in a column that
belong to Majority rule consensus are being highlighted by removing background
colors on deviating characters.</p>


<h2><a name="primer_menu">Primer:</a></h2>

<p><strong>Find primer in current selection:</strong>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Note</strong> - You can change the essential parameters when searching for primers in the <a href="#Find_Primer_settings">Find primer settings</a>
<br>
<br>
1. Select a block in the Alignment where you want to find a primer.<br>
2. Select the menu "Find primer in current selection"<br>
3. AliView will now open a window with all possible primers in the selected region (min length and max length of the primer is specified in "Find primer settings") as an ordered list sorted by the number of degenerate positions, self-binding values and melting temperature (TM).<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/find_primer_result_win.png">
<br>
<br>
4. If you click on a specific primer Another window will open with all primer details - and the primer position will also be highlighted in the alignment.<br>
<br>

<h2><a name="external_commands_menu">External commands:</a></h2>

<p><strong>Edit external commands:</strong> You can have AliView call other programs with the current alignment as a parameter <a href=#EXTERNAL_COMMANDS>see here for examples how to design a command</a></p>

<h2><a name="help_menu">Help menu</a></h2>

<p><strong>Help</strong> AliView will open this document from this menu.....</p>


<h2><a name="large_file">Load more sequences from file</a></h2>

<p>If you have opened a large file and all sequences were not indexed at once,
this menu will show up and you can select other parts of the file to index. You
can also change the number of sequences to index at once in the Program
preferences, <a href="#General_settings">General settings</a></p>

<h2><a name="memory_settings">Memory settings</a></h2>

<p>If you want AliView to read larger alignments in memory and not from file
(this allows for more editing capabilities), then you can change the maximum
memory settings for the program.</p>

<p>The amount of memory needed for a file to be read into memory is about 2 x file size.</p>

<p><b>Mac OS X</b> </p>

<p>Go to Applications in Finder --&gt;Left click on specific application
AliView --&gt; Show Package Content --&gt; Contents --&gt; Then open the file
"Info.Plist" in a text-editor and change the parameter: &lt;string&gt;-Xmx512m
-Xms128m&lt;/string&gt; to something different (for example 2GB=2048M):<br>
&lt;string&gt;-Xmx2048m -Xms128m&lt;/string&gt;</p>

<p><b>Linux</b> </p>

<p>/usr/bin/aliview <br>
open this file in text-editor and change the parameter -Xmx1024M (default
setting = 1024M memory)</p>

<p><b>Windows</b> </p>

<p>In the installation folder of AliView (default: "c:\Program Files\AliView\")
open the file "AliView.l4j.ini" in a text editor and change the setting:
-Xmx1024m to something you prefer (for example 2GB=2048M) -Xmx2048m</p>

<h2><a name="EXTERNAL_COMMANDS">External commands - Send the alignment to other
programs</a></h2>
<img style="width: 600px;" alt="" src="images/external_program_settings.png">
<br>


<p>You can send the active alignment from AliView as a command parameter to
other programs and create a simple pipeline of commands executed from a
Menu-button in AliView. </p>
Each line is executed as a separate command waiting for the previous to have
finished, as an example is a simple combination of commands that are taking the
current alignment and running it in FastTree to create a Maximum Likelihood Tree
and finally opening the resulting tree in FigTree.<br>
<br>
Special Parameters:<br>
CURRENT_ALIGNMENT_FASTA = The current alignment as a fasta file<br>
CURRENT_ALIGNMENT_PHYLIP = The current alignment as a phylip file<br>
TEMP_OUT_FILE = An empty temporary file created by AliView in the
temp-directory of the computer<br>
